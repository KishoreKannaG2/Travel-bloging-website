  <div class="section-number">/ 01 — Himalayas</div>
  <h2>Shimla: The Queen of the Hills</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Colonial charm meets Himalayan beauty in India's most iconic hill station</p>

  <p>
    Shimla, perched at 2,159 meters above sea level, is a place where time seems to move slower. 
    Set against the backdrop of the lower Himalayas, this charming destination retains its colonial heritage while offering modern comforts. 
    Walk through the misty mornings and you'll understand why the British fell in love with this place.
  </p>

  <img src="https://www.oyorooms.com/travel-guide/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BlogImage-12thAug-Shimla_7-1.jpg" alt="Shimla landscape" />

  <p>
    The town's iconic Mall Road stretches for miles, lined with colonial-era buildings, cafes, and shops. 
    Whether you're sipping hot tea at a quaint café or browsing local handicrafts, there's a distinct charm that permeates the air. 
    The nearby Christ Church, one of the oldest churches in North India, stands as a testament to the town's rich history.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong> March–June and December–February. 
    March to May offers pleasant weather and blooming flowers, while December to February brings occasional snowfall, 
    transforming Shimla into a winter wonderland.
  </div>

  <p>
    <strong>Getting There:</strong> Shimla is easily accessible by road from Delhi (around 7 hours) or via the scenic toy-train from Kalka 
    (a UNESCO World Heritage route that takes about 5 hours). The journey itself is an experience not to be missed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Popular activities include nature walks to Jakhoo Temple, heritage strolls through old colonial districts, 
    trekking to nearby ridges, and indulging in local Himachali cuisine. Don't miss the panoramic views from Kufri and the adventure sports at Narkanda.<br><br>

  <h2>Coorg: The Coffee Country</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Lush plantations and emerald valleys in South India's most verdant region</p>

  <p>
    Coorg (officially Kodagu) is often called the coffee capital of India, and for good reason. 
    Rolling coffee estates, misty mornings, and a sense of serenity make this destination a paradise for travelers seeking solitude and natural beauty. 
    The region's elevation and climate create an almost perfect environment for growing some of the world's finest coffee.
  </p>

  <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/village-road-to-home-jungle-forest-coorg-233756065.jpg" alt="Coorg forest roads" />

  <p>
    The landscape here is dramatically different from other Indian hill stations. Dense forests, cascading waterfalls, 
    and the famous Abbey Falls create a verdant tapestry that feels almost untouched. Stay at a coffee plantation resort, 
    wake up to misty mornings, and experience the art of coffee making from seed to cup.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Must-Visit Attractions:</strong> Abbey Falls, Raja's Seat for sunset views, Tadiandamol for trekking, 
    and the numerous coffee estates that offer guided tours. Don't skip the local Coorg cuisine—chicken curry and pork preparations are legendary.
  </div>

  <p>
    The people of Coorg, known as Kodavas, have a unique culture distinct from the rest of India. 
    Their traditions, martial heritage, and warmth make interactions with locals particularly rewarding. 
    Visit during the monsoon (June–September) for lush landscapes, or in October–November for clear skies and perfect weather.

  <h2>Ooty: Tea and Timeless Beauty</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">The jewel of South India's Nilgiri Hills, where tea plantations meet alpine gardens</p>

  <p>
    Ooty (Ootacamund) is the largest town in the Nilgiri Hills and has been a favorite destination since the days of the Raj. 
    At 2,240 meters, this cool hill station is famous for its sprawling tea gardens, the iconic toy train journey, 
    and picturesque botanical gardens that showcase flora from around the world.
  </p>

  <img src="https://www.indiasinvitation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Places-to-visit-in-Ooty.jpg" alt="Ooty tea gardens" />

  <p>
    The Government Botanical Garden is a must-visit, spanning 22 hectares with over 650 species of plants and trees. 
    Stroll through manicured lawns, exotic flower beds, and ancient trees while enjoying panoramic views of the surrounding hills. 
    The garden changes with the seasons, offering different experiences throughout the year.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>The Nilgiris Mountain Railway:</strong> The toy train from Mettupalayam to Ooty is one of India's most scenic journeys. 
    Traveling through lush tea gardens and dense forests, watching the landscape transform as you climb, makes this a bucket-list experience.
  </div>

  <p>
    From Doddabetta (the highest peak in the Nilgiris) to the tranquil Ooty Lake, there's no shortage of attractions. 
    Adventure seekers can explore trekking routes, while nature enthusiasts will find endless photo opportunities. 
    The local market offers traditional crafts, spices, and the region's famous tea varieties.

  <div class="section-number">/ 04 — Palani Hills</div>
  <h2>Kodaikanal: The Princess of Hill Stations</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Ancient pine forests and pristine lakes wrapped in perpetual mist</p>

  <p>
    Kodaikanal, set at 2,133 meters above sea level, is often referred to as the "Princess of Hill Stations." 
    The town is nestled in the Palani Hills and is renowned for its pristine natural beauty, old-world charm, and peaceful atmosphere. 
    Unlike more developed destinations, Kodaikanal has maintained its quiet, intimate character.
  </p>

  <img src="https://i0.wp.com/eindiatourism.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Pine-Forest.jpg" alt="Kodaikanal pine forest" />

  <p>
    The dense pine forests surrounding the town create an ethereal environment, especially during the monsoon season when everything is shrouded in mist. 
    Kodaikanal Lake, a star-shaped lake at the heart of the town, is perfect for boating, cycling, or simply sitting by the water's edge and watching the world go by. 
    The town's 26-km lake circuit is a popular trekking route for adventurers.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Top Experiences:</strong> Boating on Kodaikanal Lake, visiting Coaker's Walk for sunset views, exploring Pillar Rocks, 
    trekking through pine forests, and visiting the Green Valley View (also called Suicide Point—named for its sheer cliff views, not for any dark reason).
  </div>

  <p>
    The town is smaller and quieter than Ooty, making it ideal for those seeking introspection and peace. 
    Local cuisine influenced by Tamil, Malayali, and British traditions is a culinary delight. 
    Visit in April–May for clear skies, or June–September for the misty monsoon season—both offer distinct but equally beautiful experiences.

  <h2>Goa: Sun, Sand, and Serenity</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Golden beaches, vibrant culture, and Portuguese colonial heritage on India's western coast</p>

  <p>
    Goa is India's most famous beach destination, a place where pristine Arabian Sea beaches meet lush tropical landscapes. 
    With a unique blend of Indian and Portuguese influences, Goa offers a distinctive cultural experience that sets it apart from other Indian destinations.

  <p>
    The beaches are Goa's crown jewels. From the bustling Baga Beach with its water sports and beach shacks to the quieter, 
    more serene Palolem Beach in South Goa, each beach has its own character. The sunsets here are legendary—golden light painting the sky 
    as the sun dips below the horizon, a moment you'll treasure forever.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">

    explore the colorful Portuguese architecture of Panjim, and discover Hindu temples like Mahalaxmi Temple that reflect Goa's spiritual diversity.
  </div>

  <p>
    Goa's culinary scene is exceptional. Fresh seafood, coconut-based curries, and the famous Goan fish curry are must-tries. 
    The state's relaxed atmosphere, combined with vibrant nightlife in areas like Baga and Calangute, makes it perfect for both party-goers and peace-seekers. 
    Best time to visit: October–March for pleasant weather and lower humidity.

  <p class="subtitle">French-inspired colonial charm blended with Indian spirituality and coastal beauty</p>

  <p>
    Pondicherry, a Union Territory on the Coromandel Coast, is a captivating blend of French colonial architecture, Indian spirituality, 
    and tropical beaches. Once a French colonial possession, the town retains its European charm with tree-lined streets, French cuisine, 
    and pastel-colored buildings that transport you to a different era.
